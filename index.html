					<h3>
						Elevator Pitch
					</h3>
					<p>
						A bold, simple and disruptive tool to disseminate news across zero-rated mobile channels through which news organisations will be able to reach new audiences. 
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>
						Real world challenge
					</h3>
					<p>
						Currently most news received via mobile costs money in data charges. This is a disincentive to consume news, especially among price-conscious phone users. To reach this demographic, thereby increasing democratic participation, these costs needs to be removed. Smartphones are a luxury item. Featurephones need to be the focus of development.
					</p>
			  </article>	
			  <article>
			  	<h3>
			  		How is your project different from what others are already doing? 
				</h3>
			  	<p>
			  		Mxit charges for news using micro-payments and do not have a data deal with networks. Facebook and Google have deals which Zero News intends to piggyback on to disseminate news.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3>
					How and why will your solution work?
				</h3>
				<p>
					African news organisations will agree to provide a minimum of 5 news articles a day with a reasonable word count. This will be published on a 0.rss news feed which, via a PubSubHubBub server, will be instantaneously broadcast to the Zero Facebook streams of subscribers to Zero News at no cost to the user. Phones with no Internet capability will be supported via the free Gmail SMS service. News organisations can view the analytics of each article and see what news is being discussed and shared and get a real insight into a previously unreachable demographic.
				</p>

				<h3>
					Target audience
				</h3>
				<p>
					Nokia Series 40 and Symbian phones running Opera Mini are the most <a href"#6">popular</a> African phone/browser combination. Owners of this level and below are the audience.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3>
					Marketing
				</h3>
				<p>
					Involved news organisations would advertise the service through their printed papers, radio stations 	and web sites. "Zero News: 5 articles a day for free".

				<h3>
					Connections
				</h3>
				<p>
					Expressions of interest have been received from The Star Kenya, Mail and Guardian, AllAfrica.com and Media Monitoring Africa. Crucial to success is the buy-in from as many news organisations as possible. An agreement with a pan-African news agency, such as the BBC, could kickstart the interest of others.
				</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3>
					Ecosystem
				</h3>
				<p>
					The African Media Initiative itself and the upcoming African Media Leader's Forum are perfect vehicles for persuading news organisations of the logic behind reaching and understanding a wider audience. AllAfrica has established links with a large number of outlets. Facebook and Google have experience of negotiating deals with mobile networks. The non-technical task is to bring all these entities together for a common purpose. A well-connected, Africa-based ambassador/champion is vital for this part of the proposal to succeed.
				</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3>
					Prototype
				</h3>
				<p>
					Theoretical discussions of re-purposing hourly radio news bulletins in text form to the 0.rss feed. Exploration of the Facebook API and PubSubHubBub infrastructure for the instantaneous broadcast of news. Research into low-end browser usage and compatability. Thorough reading of Facebook and Google terms of service.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3>
					Measurement of success
				</h3>
				<p>
					At least one news organisation in every African nation providing zero cost news which is widely read and actively discussed and shared.
				</p>

				<h3>
					Implementation
				</h3>
				<p>
					Once agreement has been reached with at least 3 news organisations a prototype will be built where the CMS for each will provide a 0.rss news feed and ping facility. An App Engine instance will run a PubSubHubBub server which will push news to subscribers. A simple Facebook mobile app will allow for users to select the countries of interest. Once subscribed news articles will be received on their walls. Alternatively a workflow for subscribing via Gmail SMS will be available. In the long term, a domain for Zero News itself could become zero-rated, removing the Facebook and Google dependency
